# 1. Objective

The Code of Conduct supports our endeavours to create a pleasant atmosphere in our community.

The aim of the Code of Conduct for this project within the OZG Security Challenge is to integrate the widest possible range of people from the most diverse and varied backgrounds and to promote dialogue between them. We are committed to creating a friendly, safe and welcoming environment, regardless of gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, physical and mental ability, ethnic origin and nationality, religion and belief, age and social background, and social and economic status.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations of everyone who participates in our community and the procedures to report unacceptable behaviour. We invite everyone to join us in creating safe and positive experiences for all.

## 2. Scope

We expect all contributors to abide by this Code of Conduct in all interactions with this community, whether online or in person.

This Code of Conduct is not an exhaustive list of rules for friendly, safe and inclusive interaction in the community, but conveys our values and is intended as a guideline, reference point and inspiration for positive and valuable interaction for all.

## 3. Commitment to diversity

We encourage all individuals to bring different perspectives to the project in compliance with this Code of Conduct.

## 4. Our principles

Together, we strive to contribute to the creation of a positive environment through our behaviour. As the primary mode of communication is in text form and therefore lacks the tone of voice, gestures or other context that is often crucial for understanding, it is particularly important that these positive behaviours are also conveyed in written communication.

The following behaviours are expected and required of all participants:

- Be considerate of each other and treat each other with respect.
- Use welcoming and inclusive language and choose words carefully.
- Assume positive intentions from the other person.
- Be patient and respect the time and attention of the community.
- Focus on what is best for the community.
- Actively promote dialogue and cooperation within the community.
- Practice constructive criticism and accept it with grace.

## 5. Unacceptable behaviour

We do not accept behaviour that violates our Code of Conduct.

Please report any misbehaviour or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem insignificant.

The following behaviours are considered unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our community:

- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic or otherwise discriminatory references, statements, and language choices.
- Personal insults, especially those relating to gender, sexual orientation, origin, religion, lifestyle, or disability.
- Intimidation, violence, threats of violence or violent language directed at another person.
- Unwelcome sexually intrusive language or behaviour.
- Posting or displaying sexual or violent material.
- Persistent disruption of discussion.
- Advocating or encouraging any of the above behaviours.

We cannot fully list all forms of unacceptable behaviour and harassment, nor do we attempt to declare some forms of it as harmless or not worthy of action. Rather, we ask you to report the incident if you feel harassed. Each report will be handled discreetly and solutions will be sought without public exposure, as this tends to exacerbate the problems for those affected and the community as a whole.

## 6. Become active in case of violations

Please take action and report any violation of the Code of Conduct.

If you are affected by unacceptable behaviour, witness it or have other concerns, please report it directly:

ozgsec@bmi.bund.de
or ozgsec@neuland-homeland.de

We ask that your report includes the following:

- Your preferred contact information so that we can reach you if we have any questions. Anonymous reports will also be processed, but run the risk of not being able to be processed appropriately in the event of outstanding queries.
- Usernames of the individuals involved in the incident.
- Your description of the incident and whether you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record, please provide the link to review the incident.
- Any additional information you feel may be helpful.

Please only use the contact above so that the appropriate team can respond to your report. Your matter will be handled with discretion. We respect the confidentiality of all enquiries to protect the individuals concerned.
